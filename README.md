# Web Scraping and NLP-based FAQ System

This project demonstrates the process of web scraping and using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide automated answers to user queries from documentation websites.

## Why We Are Using Google Colab

We are using **Google Colab** for the following reasons:

- **Free Cloud Resources**: Google Colab provides free access to computational resources (CPU, GPU, and TPU) which makes it easier to run complex tasks such as NLP-based content analysis without worrying about local hardware limitations.
- **Easy Integration**: Colab allows us to easily import and integrate libraries and tools without installation concerns.
- **Collaboration**: Colab offers real-time collaboration, which makes it ideal for team-based projects and sharing the notebook with others.
- **Pre-configured Environment**: The environment in Colab is pre-configured with a variety of libraries like `BeautifulSoup`, `requests`, and `SentenceTransformer` that are used for scraping and NLP tasks.

## Why We Chose Python

Python is chosen for this project due to the following reasons:

- **Rich Libraries**: Python offers an extensive set of libraries for both web scraping (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`) and NLP (`sentence-transformers`, `sklearn`). This allows rapid development with minimal effort.
- **Ease of Use**: Python's syntax is clean and easy to understand, which makes it ideal for both beginners and experienced developers.
- **Community Support**: Python has a large community with a vast amount of tutorials, resources, and documentation. This makes it easier to troubleshoot and find solutions to problems.
- **Data Processing**: Python provides powerful libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation, which is beneficial when processing and transforming scraped data.

## What This Project Does

This project automates the process of web scraping documentation websites, extracting relevant sections based on user queries, and providing the best answers using NLP techniques. Specifically, it does the following:

1. **Scrapes Documentation Websites**: It fetches the hyperlinks from a given documentation page, scrapes the content of those pages, and collects relevant information.
2. **Matches Content to User Queries**: Using NLP, the system identifies the most relevant sections of the scraped content based on user input.
3. **Returns Concise, Relevant Answers**: After processing the content, it returns a short, focused answer based on the top 3 most relevant sections of the content.
